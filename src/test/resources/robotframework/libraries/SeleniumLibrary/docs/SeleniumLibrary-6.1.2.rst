Most important enhancements
===========================

- Missing "Options" setup in EDGE browser for remote url execution (`#1844`_, rc 1)

  The browser options if given within the ``Open Browser`` or `Create WebDriver`` keyword were not being
  passed to either a remote Edge or remote Safari browser. This has been fixed within this release.

Acknowledgements
================

- I want to thank @ap0087105 for pointing out the library was missing "Options" setup within Edge and
  Safari remote url execution (`#1844`_, rc 1)
